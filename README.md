**Hi there! I'm Mellisa**

🙋‍♀️ Welcome to my GitHub repository. 

🧘‍♀️**Personal Profile**

I'm passionate about learning new skills and widening my knowledge. I'm always eager to have conversations about new and emerging technologies or areas of self improvement. 

💻**Professional Background**

I'm a Business Analyst that's worked in various industries over the past 5+ years (insurance, investments, tax - all within the Data Analytics team). Having completed the Data & SQL Coding Kickstarter with CFG earlier this year I am eager to widen my knowledge and move into a technical role having completed this degree.

⚡ Fun fact: I love early morning gym sessions!
